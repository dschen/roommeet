<p> When Princeton students often look around the country or abroad to secure summer internships, they 
require roommates and housing to make their experience in the city or country of their choosing a good one.
This web application aims to replace the seemingly endless and inefficient stream of emails that circulate
around various listservs in the Princeton community and provide an intuitive, polished, and clean interface
for interns around the world to find roommates and friends nearby. Additionally, alumni can make their voices
heard, as current students can also post available housing and choose non-Princeton contact emails.

<P> <a href="http://www.theroommeet.com" target="_blank">RoomMeet</a>
<br>The site is CAS authenticated, so you can use your Princeton netid and password to log in.

<P> <a href="presentation.pdf">your presentation slides, etc., if you used them</a>.
Please submit these as PDF or as a web page, not Powerpoint.

<P> These links must point to PDF files <b>with with exactly the
specified names</b>.  They must not require logging in to some place
like Google Docs or GitHub.  My goal is to have the submissions all in
one place and completely uniform at this level so the TAs and I can
access the pieces easily.

Thanks.
