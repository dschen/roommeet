<P> 
When Princeton students often look around the country or abroad to secure summer internships, they require roommates and housing to make their experience in the city or country of their choosing a good one. This web application aims to replace the seemingly endless and inefficient stream of emails that circulate around various listservs in the Princeton community and provide an intuitive, polished, and clean interface for interns around the world to find roommates and friends nearby. Additionally, alumni can make their voices heard, as current students can also post available housing and choose non-Princeton contact emails.
