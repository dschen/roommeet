	The second greatest obstacle in determining summer plans is finding an affordable place to stay and people to stay with. RoomMeet is a networking platform for Princeton students looking for summer housing to connect with one another.  Users can find other students staying near to them over the summer, potentially to join as roommates and cut housing costs or just to see who is going to be in the area.  It also connects housing to students by allowing users with temporary housing availabilities to post their accomadations on a network-wide map.

	<p>
		When visiting RoomMeet for the first time you'll be immediately redirected to the profile page where we ask for basic information about you as well as some info about your summer plans: What company are you working for?  Are you looking form a roommate or just trying to find other Princeton people in the are?  The last step to joining RoomMeet is clicking on the map where you'll be working or living this summer so you can find people working or living near you.  You'll appear as a green star.  As soon as you're done, click Save and you'll be redirected to the Meet page.  You can go back and edit this information at any time by clicking on the word "Profile" in the top navigation bar.

		The next step in using RoomMeet is meeting people.  The Meet page displays your green star icon along with every other RoomMeet user (red figures) as well as all the available houses.  Notice the filters along the bottom navigation bar.  These will be handy now, since you don't care much about students and housing in California if you're spending the summer in New Jersey.  The next step will be to select filter preferences so you can find nearby students and useful housing.

	<h2 class="cover-heading">Talk</h2>

	<p>
		In this example we decided to concentrate only on students and houses within 50 miles of our pin.  On top of this, we're looking for members of the class of 2016 who have any amount of date overlap with our start and end dates (since we don't care about people who won't be around while we are).  Now that we've filtered our students and housing we can click on people's pins and add them to our Talk page.  The Talk page is shown above (note the Talk tab in the top navigation bar is toggled).  This page shows you the name, class year, start and end dates and distance from you of every person you've added from the map.  By clicking on one of the names you can see more information, including their email address, allowing you to contact them in order to meet up or discuss becoming roommates.

	<p>
		The last part of RoomMeet is the housing page.  As a student looking for housing, this page works very similarly to the Talk page.  When you click on blue houses on the map they are added here and you can view their information as well as get a contact email address putting you in contact with the owner.  If you have housing and are looking for renters then you can post your housing on the map by clicking the "Add New House" button, clicking on the map where your housing is located and filling out the housing form.  You can edit the information for houses you've posted or delete them by clicking the "Manage My Houses" button.
