Alrighty. Read this before doing anything so that you don't accidentally delete our entire project...

1) Create a new branch for yourself to edit in

2) When done editing, merge your branch with the master copy. (Pull request)

3) Regularly sync your local files with the master.

4) Make sure that your branch is updated before you start editing.

5) If a conflict arises when you try to merge your branch with the master, then you have disobeyed something listed above.

Cheers
